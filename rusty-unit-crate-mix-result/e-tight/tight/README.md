# Tight

Tight is a simple expense tracker, written in Rust. Contributions are
welcome, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for help getting started.

This is in very early stages of development, so I apologise if this
documentation is a bit sparse. I figured sparse would be better than
misleading when I change something fundamental.

## Building

Tight is built with Cargo, the Rust package manager.

Use `cargo build` to compile, and find the resulting binary in
`target/debug/tight`. You can also run `cargo build --release` for a
release build.

## Documentation

Run `cargo doc --open` to open the documentation for both Tight and its
dependencies in a web browser.
